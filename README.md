This is a Unity project that I've started with a few classmates.
At first we weren't sure of what we wanted to make yet. We just knew that we wanted to make it a 2D game, since we all had experience with drawing 2D sprites, and programming on a 2D plane is easier. And I then suggested that it be a multiplayer game, because I like making multiplayer games. We ended up with the idea of making a clone of Stickfight. That's a fast-paced PvP game where you run around on platforms and try using various items that spawn around the place to win the round.
And that seemed fun.
